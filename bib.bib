  title = {Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep Feedforward Neural Networks},
  abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

While Hidden Markov Models tend to ignore this information, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can in principle learn to make use of it. We focus on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) because it has been shown to outperform other RNNs on tasks involving long time lags. We find that LSTM augmented by "peephole connections" from its internal cells to its multiplicative gates can learn the fine distinction between sequences of spikes spaced either 50 or 49 time steps apart without the help of any short training exemplars. Without external resets or teacher forcing, our LSTM variant also learns to generate stable streams of precisely timed spikes and other highly nonlinear periodic patterns. This makes LSTM a promising approach for tasks that require the accurate measurement or generation of time intervals.},

The main challenges addressed in this paper are automatic selection of the relevant features and optimal feature representation for probabilistic models. For prediction of visual backchannel cues (i.e., head nods), our prediction model shows a statistically significant improvement over a previously published approach based on hand-crafted rules.},

In telecommunications, `aizuchi' responses are quite important to inform the hearer's condition to the speaker. In a man-machine telecommunication environment, user's comfortableness may improve if a dialog system can give suitable `aizuchi' to user's utterances. For this purpose, it is important that a system detect conditions of `aizuchi' insertion and insert one at appropriate timing. Firstly, occurances of `aizuchi' were analyzed using a simulated dialog corpus of telephone-shopping-tasks. This showed that there are some prosodic cues in utterances in which `aizuchi' is inserted. Then, timing of `aizuchi' insertion was investigated and perceptual experiments were carried out. Lastly, we made a system which gives `aizuchi' using prosodic information. This system detected suitable positions which agreed with original `aizuchi's with 77\% correct rate},

The end result of this research will be a virtual human able to automatically respond to a human speaker with proper listener responses (e.g., head nods). Our novel speaker-adaptive prediction model is created from a corpus of dyadic interactions where speaker variability is analyzed to identify a subset of prototypical speaker styles. During a live interaction our prediction model automatically identifies the closest prototypical speaker style and predicts listener responses based on this ``communicative style". Central to our approach is the idea of ``speaker profile" which uniquely identifies each speaker and enables the matching between prototypical speakers and new speakers. The paper shows the merits of our speaker-adaptive listener response prediction model by showing improvement over a state-of-the-art approach which does not adapt to the speaker. Besides the merits of speaker-adapta-tion, our experiments highlights the importance of using multimodal features when comparing speakers to select the closest prototypical speaker style.},

In this paper, we developed a dialog system which could generate chat-like responses and their timing using a decision tree. The system could perform ``collaborative completion,'' ``aizuchi'' (back-channel) and so on. The decision tree utilized the pitch and the power contours of user's utterance, recognition hypotheses, and response preparation status of the response generator, at every time segment as features to generate response timing.},

  abstract = {During face-to-face interactions, listeners use backchannel feedback such as head nods as a signal to the speaker that the communication is working and that they should continue speaking. Predicting these backchannel opportunities is an important milestone for building engaging and natural virtual humans. In this paper we show how sequential probabilistic models (e.g., Hidden Markov Model or Conditional Random Fields) can automatically learn from a database of human-to-human interactions to predict listener backchannels using the speaker multimodal output features (e.g., prosody, spoken words and eye gaze). The main challenges addressed in this paper are automatic selection of the relevant features and optimal feature representation for probabilistic models. For prediction of visual backchannel cues (i.e., head nods), our prediction model shows a statistically significant improvement over a previously published approach based on hand-crafted rules.},

  abstract = {Traditionally listener response prediction models are learned from pre-recorded dyadic interactions. Because of individual differences in behavior, these recordings do not capture the complete ground truth. Where the recorded listener did not respond to an opportunity provided by the speaker, another listener would have responded or vice versa. In this paper, we introduce the concept of parallel listener consensus where the listener responses from multiple parallel interactions are combined to better capture differences and similarities between individuals. We show how parallel listener consensus can be used for both learning and evaluating probabilistic prediction models of listener responses. To improve the learning performance, the parallel consensus helps identifying better negative samples and reduces outliers in the positive samples. We propose a new error measurement called fConsensus which exploits the parallel consensus to better define the concepts of exactness (mislabels) and completeness (missed labels) for prediction models. We present a series of experiments using the MultiLis Corpus where three listeners were tricked into believing that they had a one-on-one conversation with a speaker, while in fact they were recorded in parallel in interaction with the same speaker. In this paper we show that using parallel listener consensus can improve learning performance and represent better evaluation criteria for predictive models.},

  abstract = {Virtual humans are embodied software agents that should not only be realistic looking but also have natural and realistic behaviors. Traditional virtual human systems learn these interaction behaviors by observing how individuals respond in face-to-face situations (i.e., dir ect interaction). In contrast, this paper introduces a novel methodological approach called paras ocial consensus sampling (PCS) which allows multiple individuals to vicariously experience the same situation to gain insight on the typical (i.e., consensus view) of human responses in social interaction. This approach can help tease a part what is idiosyncratic from what is essential and help reveal the strength of cues that elicit social responses. Our PCS approach has several advantages over traditional methods: (1) it integrates data from multiple independent listeners interacting with the same speaker, (2) it associates probability of how likely feedback will be given over time, (3) it can be used as a prior to analyze and understand the face-to-face interaction data, (4) it facilitates much quicker and cheaper data collection. In this paper, we apply our PCS approach to learn a predictive model of listener backchannel feedback. Our experiments demonstrate that a virtual human driven by our PCS approach creates significantly more rapport and is perceived as more believable than the virtual human driven by face-to-face interaction data.},

Learning to predict when to give such feedback is one of the keys to creating natural and realistic virtual humans. Prediction models are traditionally learned from large corpora of annotated face-to-face interactions, but this approach has several limitations. Previously, we proposed a novel data collection method, Parasocial Consensus Sampling, which addresses these limitations. In this paper, we show that data collected in this manner can produce effective learned models. A subjective evaluation shows that the virtual human driven by the resulting probabilistic model significantly outperforms a previously published rule-based agent in terms of rapport, perceived accuracy and naturalness, and it is even better than the virtual human driven by real listeners' behavior in some cases.},

We used six rule-based strategies to determine the placement of BCs. The BCs were performed by an intelligent virtual agent using nods and vocalizations. In a user perception experiment, participants were shown video fragments of a human speaker together with an artificial listener who produced BC behavior according to one of the strategies. Participants were asked to rate how likely they thought the BC behavior had been performed by a human listener. We found that the number, timing and type of BC had a significant effect on how human-like the BC behavior was perceived.},

IPL combines perceptual evaluation with iterative model refinement. Human observers rate the appropriateness of synthesized behaviors in the context of a conversation. These ratings are used to refine the machine learning models that predict the social signal timings. As the ratings correspond to those moments in the conversation where the production of a specific behavior is inappropriate, we regard features extracted at these moments as negative samples for the training of a classifier. This is an advantage over the traditional corpus-based approach to extract negative samples at random non-positive moments. We perform a comparison between IPL and the traditional corpus-based approach on the timing of backchannels for a listener in speaker\textendash{}listener dialogs. While both models perform similarly in terms of precision and recall scores, there is a tendency that the backchannels generated with IPL are rated as more appropriate. We additionally investigate the effect of the amount of available training data and the variation of training data on the outcome of the models.},

  abstract = {We present an incremental lattice generation approach to speech act detection for spontaneous and overlapping speech in telephone conversations (CallHome Spanish). At each stage of the process it is therefore possible to use different models after the initial HMM models have generated a reasonable set of hypothesis. These lattices can be processed further by more complex models. This study shows how neural networks can be used very effectively in the classification of speech acts. We find that speech acts can be classified better using the neural net based approach than using the more classical ngram backoff model approach. The best resulting neural network operates only on unigrams and the integration of the ngram backoff model as a prior to the model reduces the performance of the model. The neural network can therefore more likely be robust against errors from an LVCSR system and can potentially be trained from a smaller database},
