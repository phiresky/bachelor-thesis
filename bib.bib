The current research focus is on expanding beyond tasksinvolving a single limited semantic domain to significantly broaderand richer domains. To achieve this goal, The MT components of oursystem have been engineered to build and manipulate multi-domain parselattices that are based on modular grammars for multiple semanticdomains. This approach yields solutions to several problems includingmulti-domain disambiguation, segmentation of spoken utterances intosentence units, modularity of system design, and re-use of earliersystems with incompatible output.},

  abstract = {We manually designed rules for a backchannel (BC) prediction model based on pitch and pause information. In short, the model predicts a BC when there is a pause of a certain length that is preceded by a falling or rising pitch. This model was validated against the Dutch IFADV Corpus in a corpus-based evaluation method. The results showed that our model performs slightly better than another well-known rule-based BC prediction model that uses only pitch information. We observed that the length of a pause preceding a BC is one of the important features in this model, next to the duration of the pitch slope at the end of an utterance. Further, we discuss implications of a corpus-based approach to BC prediction evaluation.},

  abstract = {During face-to-face interactions, listeners use backchannel feedback such as head nods as a signal to the speaker that the communication is working and that they should continue speaking. Predicting these backchannel opportunities is an important milestone for building engaging and natural virtual humans. In this paper we show how sequential probabilistic models (e.g., Hidden Markov Model or Conditional Random Fields) can automatically learn from a database of human-to-human interactions to predict listener backchannels using the speaker multimodal output features (e.g., prosody, spoken words and eye gaze). The main challenges addressed in this paper are automatic selection of the relevant features and optimal feature representation for probabilistic models. For prediction of visual backchannel cues (i.e., head nods), our prediction model shows a statistically significant improvement over a previously published approach based on hand-crafted rules.},

  abstract = {Rapport, the feeling of being “in sync” with your conversational partners, is argued to underlie many desirable social effects. By generating proper verbal and nonverbal behaviors, virtual humans have been seen to create rapport during interactions with human users. In this paper, we introduce our approach to creating rapport following Tickle-Degnen and Rosenberg’s threefactor (positivity, mutual attention and coordination) theory of rapport. By comparing with a previously published virtual agent, the Rapport Agent, we show that our virtual human predicts the timing of backchannel feedback and end-of-turn more precisely, performs more natural behaviors and, thereby creates much stronger feelings of rapport between users and virtual agents.},
