# Backchannel Prediction for Conversational Speech Using Recurrent Neural Networks (Bachelor Thesis)

The built thesis pdf is here: https://github.com/phiresky/bachelor-thesis/blob/master/build/thesis.pdf.

A shorter version with mostly the same content is my paper [_Enhancing Backchannel Prediction Using Word Embeddings_](http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2017/abstracts/1606.html) published at Interspeech 2017.

The corresponding code is at https://github.com/phiresky/backchannel-prediction.
